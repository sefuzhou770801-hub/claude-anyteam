"""Guard against the mark_as_read data-loss landmine.

cs50victor's `read_inbox(..., mark_as_read=True)` rewrites the entire inbox
file using its own Pydantic serializer. If the adapter ever calls that path
on another teammate's inbox (typo in agent name, copy-paste bug, etc.), any
harness-written fields not modeled by cs50victor would be stripped. This
could destroy real messages the lead hasn't read yet.

`protocol_io.read_own_inbox(team, self_name, agent_name)` asserts
`self_name == agent_name`. This test proves the guard fires.
