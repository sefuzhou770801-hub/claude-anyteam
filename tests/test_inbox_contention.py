"""Inbox write-contention tests.

M0 observation #4: the Claude Code harness appends to the inbox JSON array
and may set `read: false` concurrently with our adapter's poll+mark-as-read.
We need to tolerate partial reads, malformed intermediate states, and not
lose messages when a race occurs.

These tests use cs50victor's `messaging` module against a tempdir, spawning
concurrent appenders (simulating the harness) and readers (simulating the
adapter). We assert:

1. No message is permanently lost during concurrent operation.
2. JSON parse errors are tolerated (our protocol_io wrapper returns []
   rather than crashing).
3. The `.lock` file is created under inboxes/ by cs50victor on first
   write — documenting the behavior explicitly.
