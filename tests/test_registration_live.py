"""Live-filesystem integration tests for registration.

These run against the real `~/.claude/teams/codex-teammate/` on this machine.
They self-clean: each test adds a uniquely-named fixture, asserts state,
then removes it. Existing team members (including `test-peer`) are not
touched.

Run via:  uv run pytest -v tests/test_registration_live.py
