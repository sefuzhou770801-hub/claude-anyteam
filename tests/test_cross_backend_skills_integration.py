"""Cross-backend skills integration test (PoC A + PoC C, v0.8.4).

Locks the empirical contract validated against live codex teammates in the
``marketing-skill-test`` team:

1. The shared ``skill_discovery`` cache picks up both in-repo skills and
   marketplace skills under ``~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*/skills/``.
2. The C-side ``compose_project_skills_fragment`` heuristic correctly maps
   diverse domain tasks (cold email, SEO, copywriting, marketing ideas) to
   the right top-1 skill name.
3. The fragment shape includes the explicit
   ``mcp_anyteam_invoke_skill('<name>')`` invitation so the receiving LLM
   has a concrete next step.
4. The A-side fragment text instructs the LLM to call the MCP tool, NOT to
   inline-read the path. (PoC C does NOT inline SKILL.md bodies — §1-safe.)

The integration of A's MCP tools with C's fragment was validated end-to-end
against live codex-app-server teammates; this test locks the unit-level
invariants that make the integration work. A regression here means the live
seamless-inheritance behavior will break.
