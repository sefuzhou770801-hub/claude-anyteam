"""v7 narrowed MCP server exposing a safe tool subset to the Codex subprocess.

**Why a narrowed MCP surface.** The full team-control surface includes
destructive lifecycle operations (`team_delete`, `force_kill_teammate`,
`spawn_teammate`, `team_create`, `process_shutdown_approved`,
`check_teammate`) that have no business being accessible from a running
teammate's context. A hallucinated tool call to any of them would have
outsized consequences.

Rather than rely on prompt discipline, this wrapper exposes **only the
small tool set a Codex teammate actually needs mid-task**, with descriptions
tuned for the team-protocol context and team/agent identity pre-filled
from startup env so Codex can't accidentally send as the wrong teammate.

The wrapper delegates internally to the `claude_teams` team-protocol
implementation for file I/O, locking, and schema handling. This keeps
the v6 invariants intact while narrowing the surface Codex sees.

Launched as a stdio subprocess by Codex via `-c mcp_servers.*.command=...`
overrides on `codex exec`. Lifetime matches the Codex invocation.

Environment:
- `CLAUDE_ANYTEAM_TEAM` — our team name (required).
- `CLAUDE_ANYTEAM_NAME` — our teammate name within the team (required).

Legacy `CODEX_TEAMMATE_*` identity vars are still honored as fallbacks during the rebrand.
