"""Per-incident diagnostic capture for adapter prose-reply failures.

When a backend's prose handler can't produce a reply (subprocess timeout,
schema-validation failure, MCP tool unavailable, crash, etc.), the
user-facing fallback message has to stay terse — it goes to the lead's
chat surface and must not leak stack traces, PII from the inbound prompt,
or stderr noise.

This module bridges the gap between "captured but discarded" (today's
behavior — the wrapper logs full error context to stderr and throws it
away in the chat reply) and "leaked unsafely" (dumping raw error strings
into the user-visible reply).

Pattern:
- The handler calls `record_incident()` with the full structured context.
- A short stable `incident_id` (`inc-<8 hex chars>`) is generated and
  the diagnostic file is written to
  `~/.claude/teams/<team>/diagnostics/<agent>/<incident_id>.json`.
- The handler embeds the `incident_id` in the prose fallback so the lead
  can find the file.

Broadly applicable: every backend (Codex / Gemini / Kimi) and every
failure shape (timeout, crash, schema-fail, MCP-missing) flows through
the same surface. Adding a new backend is a one-call integration.
