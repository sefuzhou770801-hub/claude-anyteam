"""System-prompt and task-prompt builders for v7.

v7 gives Codex MCP tool access to the narrowed wrapper (`wrapper_server`),
so the prompt must teach Codex about those tools and when to use them.
Keep the language tight — longer prompts are harder for Codex to follow.

`_plan_prompt` and `_task_prompt` in `loop.py` call into these builders
so the prompt contract is in one place and visible to reviewer at
validation time.
