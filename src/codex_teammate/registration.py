"""Self-registration with a Claude Code team.

The adapter starts independently of the harness and appends its own member
entry to `~/.claude/teams/{team}/config.json`. M0 confirmed the harness
tolerates this: the config mutation is preserved, and the harness delivers
messages to an inbox file the adapter creates itself.

Registration is idempotent. If a member with our name already exists, we
treat it as an existing registration (do not duplicate, do not mutate).
