"""Codex CLI invocation.

Wraps `codex exec` with `--json` (JSONL progress events) and optionally
`--output-schema` (schema-constrained final response). One entrypoint:

- `run(prompt, cwd, schema=...)` — runs a single `codex exec` subprocess
  with `--full-auto --json [--output-schema <schema>]`. Returns a
  `CodexResult` with exit code, the parsed structured response (when a
  schema was passed), the raw last message, and the JSONL event stream.

The control loop uses this for two purposes:
- Task completion (`schema=TASK_COMPLETE_SCHEMA`) — get Codex to do the
  work and produce a `{files_changed, summary}` response.
- Plan generation (`schema=PLAN_SCHEMA`) — opt-in plan-mode path; Codex
  drafts a structured plan for lead approval without executing work.

The adapter never parses free-form prose from Codex. If the `--output-schema`
pathway fails to produce conforming output, `run()` surfaces it via
`CodexResult.structured is None` / `CodexResult.error is not None` and the
control loop decides what to do (retry, mark blocked, etc.).
