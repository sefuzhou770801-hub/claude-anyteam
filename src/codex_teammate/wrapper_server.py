"""v7 narrowed MCP server exposing a safe tool subset to the Codex subprocess.

**Why a wrapper, not cs50victor directly.** cs50victor exposes 13 tools
including destructive lifecycle operations (`team_delete`,
`force_kill_teammate`, `spawn_teammate`, `team_create`,
`process_shutdown_approved`, `check_teammate`) that have no business
being accessible from a running teammate's context. A hallucinated tool
call to any of them would have outsized consequences.

Rather than rely on prompt discipline, this wrapper exposes **only the
six tools a Codex teammate actually needs mid-task**, with descriptions
tuned for the team-protocol context and team/agent identity pre-filled
from startup env so Codex can't accidentally send as the wrong teammate.

The wrapper uses cs50victor as a library internally — all file I/O,
locking, and schema handling are unchanged. This keeps the v6
invariants intact while narrowing the surface Codex sees.

Launched as a stdio subprocess by Codex via `-c mcp_servers.*.command=...`
overrides on `codex exec`. Lifetime matches the Codex invocation.

Environment:
- `CODEX_TEAMMATE_TEAM` — our team name (required).
- `CODEX_TEAMMATE_NAME` — our teammate name within the team (required).
